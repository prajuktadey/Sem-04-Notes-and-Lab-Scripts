    <dl>
        <dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Electronics and Telecommunication Enginnering (ETC) : </b></dt>
        <dd>Electronics and telecommunications engineering ( ETE) is a branch of electrical engineering that focuses on <i>designing and developing electronic technology products.</i> Electrical engineers work in many sectors, including healthcare, media and communications and software technology.</dd>
        <br>
        <dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) :</b></dt>
        <dd>Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) is an academic program at many universities which comprises <i>scientific and engineering aspects of computing.</i></dd>
        <br>
        <dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mechanical Engineering (MECH) :</b></dt>
        <dd>Mechanical engineering is the study of <i>physical machines that may involve force and movement.</i>  It is an engineering branch that combines engineering physics and mathematics principles with materials science, to design, analyze, manufacture, and maintain mechanical systems.</dd>
    </dl>

    <p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;You can choose from courses in English and many other languages as per your convenience.</b></p>

    <h3>&nbsp;Courses we offer (ETC): </h3>
    <ul>
      <li><b><i>Principles of Digital Communication:</i></b></li>
      <dd>Digital communication is a field in which theoretical ideas have had an unusually powerful impact on system design and practice.</dd>
      <br>
      <li><b><i>Control Systems:</i></b></li>
      <dd>This course provides an introduction to linear systems, transfer functions, and Laplace transforms. It covers stability and feedback, and provides basic design tools for specifications of transient response.</dd>
      <br>
      <li><b><i>Digital Electronics:</i></b></li>
      <dd><b>Digital electronics</b> is a field of electronics involving the study of digital signals and the engineering of devices that use or produce them.</dd>
      <br>
    </ul>

    <h3>&nbsp;Courses we offer (CSE): </h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b><i>Data Structures and Alogorithms:</i></b></li>
        <dd><b>Data structures</b> are ways of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently. Common data structures include arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs.</dd>
        <dd><b>Algorithms</b> are a set of instructions for solving a specific problem or performing a specific task. </dd>
        <br>
        <li><b><i>Object Oriented Programming in C++:</i></b></li>
        <dd><b>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)</b> is a programming paradigm in C++ (and other programming languages) that is based on the concept of "objects", which can be thought of as instances of a class.</dd>
        <br>
        <li><b><i>Web Technology:</i></b></li>
        <dd>Web technology in Java refers to the use of the Java programming language to create web applications and services. Java is widely used for web development due to its platform-independent nature, robustness, and security features.</dd>
        <br>
        <li><b><i>Computer Organization and Architecture:</i></b></li>
        <dd>Computer organization and architecture refers to the way in which the various components of a computer system are arranged and how they interact with one another. It encompasses both the physical organization of the computer hardware, as well as the logical organization of the software that controls the hardware.</dd>
        <br>
    </ul>

    <h3>&nbsp;Courses we offer (MECH): </h3>
    <ul>
      <li><b><i>Dynamics and Vibration:</i></b></li>
      <dd>Dynamics and vibration are closely related fields of study in mechanical engineering that deal with the motion of mechanical systems.</dd>
      <br>
      <li><b><i>Engineering Design:</i></b></li>
      <dd>Engineering design is the process of devising a system, component, or process to meet desired needs. It is a problem-solving process that involves the creation of new and innovative solutions to real-world problems.</dd>
      <br>
      <li><b><i>Fluid Mechanics:</i></b></li>
      <dd>Fluid mechanics is the branch of physics that deals with the behavior of fluids (liquids and gases) at rest and in motion. It encompasses the study of fluid statics (the behavior of fluids at rest) and fluid dynamics (the behavior of fluids in motion).</dd>
